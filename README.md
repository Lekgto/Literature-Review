## 📄 Overview

This literature review explores the intersection between **advanced technologies**—specifically **Artificial Intelligence (AI)**, the **Internet of Things (IoT)**, and **Big Data**—and the **human right to development**, with a focused lens on two critical areas: **food security** and **healthcare**.

The review builds upon the 1986 United Nations Declaration on the Right to Development and contextualizes it within the framework of the **Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)**, particularly:
- 🥗 **Goal 2: Zero Hunger**
- 🏥 **Goal 3: Good Health and Well-being**

## 🧠 Key Themes and Findings

- **AI in Healthcare:** Clinical Decision Support Systems (CDSS) are transforming diagnosis and treatment, yet raise concerns of data privacy, overreliance, and unequal access.
- **IoT in Agriculture:** Precision farming tools increase crop yields and reduce waste, but infrastructure gaps hinder adoption in under-resourced regions.
- **Big Data Analytics:** Enables pattern recognition and informed decision-making, but access is capital-intensive and benefits are unevenly distributed.
- **Ethical Considerations:** E-waste, surveillance concerns, and algorithmic bias present challenges to equitable technological progress.
- **The Digital Divide:** Technological advancements risk exacerbating inequality without intentional, inclusive policy frameworks.

## 📘 Abstract

> This thematic literature review assesses how emerging technologies influence the fulfillment of the human right to development. While AI, IoT, and Big Data offer tools to support food security and healthcare, disparities in infrastructure, access, and policy enforcement reveal a digital divide. The review argues for inclusive innovation and ethical governance as prerequisites to ensuring that technology serves as a force for global equity.
